# crypto-screener

CryptoScreener is a real-time cryptocurrency analysis terminal, providing global market statistics, information on trending tokens, a searchable token table, and a comprehensive token detail page including charts, real-time prices, and exchange data. It operates using CoinGecko REST API interfaces and a WebSocket API for real-time market data streaming with sub-second latency — offering everyone the opportunity to build advanced, data-driven crypto and Web3 projects.

This project uses the Bun runtime and TypeScript. The main entry point is `index.ts`.
